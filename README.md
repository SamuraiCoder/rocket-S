C++ framework to create a 2D game.

This is just a small project I want to try in order to check how SDL2 works and basically start making a simple engine to load some sprites animate them, etc. 

I'm thinking maybe I will base everything in one of my favourites 2D game "Metal Slug" and instead of bullets it will throw roses =)
